Stable Polyfit

This is a wrapper for the github project dedoardo/polyfit.
All that is done here is applying a pre-processing layer to
the given pixel art first to eliminate issues caused by transparent holes in images.

To run, simply call:
```python run_polyfit_stable.py <input image> <output SVG>```
